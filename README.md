# PanWriter

PanWriter is a distraction-free markdown editor with two unique features:

1. Tight integration with pandoc for import/export to/from plenty of file formats (including HTML, docx, LaTeX and EPUB).
2. Preview pane that can show pages â€“ including page breaks etc. Layout adjustments are immediately reflected in the preview.

Read the [MANUAL](https://www.panwriter.com/MANUAL.html) for more info.

**[Download PanWriter](https://www.panwriter.com)**

You also have to [install pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) to export to most formats.

## Develop

Install git and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), then:

    git clone git@github.com:mb21/panwriter.git
    cd panwriter
    yarn install

    ## To run the app in development mode:
    yarn run electron:dev

    ## To build distributable app package (goes to ./dist):
    yarn dist

Check out the `package.json` for more scripts to run.

### Using Docker Compose

Install Docker and Docker Compose for your system, then:

    git clone git@github.com:mb21/panwriter.git
    cd panwriter
    docker compose build
    mkdir dist

This will prepare a docker image, which can be used for development.

#### Start an interactive bash shell

    docker compose run --rm -it panwriter

The directories

- `src`
- `electron`
- `dist`

are bound into the container.
So any change you make to the source with your preferred editor
will be available in the container where you then can run the
development server or build the application.

#### useful commands

Build for

    docker compose run panwriter yarn dist        # Linux
    docker compose run panwriter yarn dist -w     # Windows
    docker compose run panwriter yarn dist -m zip # Mac OS

Start development server

    docker compose up panserver

### TODOs

- Preview:
    - respect `css`, `toc` metadata fields
- Editor:
    - expand `Format` menu
    - spell check
    - improve find/replace
- add a Settings/Preferences window (or should this just be a `settings.yaml` file?) where you can:
    - set a CodeMirror editor theme css
    - edit the default CSS and YAML files
    - choose `pandoc` executable (probably with file-open dialog, which we can use for app sandboxing with security-scoped bookmarks)
- Write pandoc lua filter that does some PanWriter-specific transformations:
  - add [page-break syntax](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/1934#issuecomment-274327751)
  - [Variable substitution in body](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/1950#issuecomment-427671251)
  - read out `type` metadata and if it references a css file, put the path into the `css` metadata variable
- GUI popup on file import: at least allow to set `-f`, `-t`, `--track-changes` and `--extract-media` pandoc options.
- Unify PanWriter custom document type and pandoc template concepts?
- Rename `type` metadata key to `doctype`?
